Facial Emotion Recognition is a fascinating field within the realm of artificial intelligence and computer vision. 
It involves the identification and interpretation of human emotions from facial expressions.
Accurate emotion detection has numerous practical applications, including human-computer interaction, customer feedback analysis, and mental health monitoring. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, revolutionizing the way we understand and process emotional cues from images.
For classifying the facial emotions FER dataset is taken and then the expressions is classified into 7 classes.
